# Core neurosama framework (if applicable, or specific components)
# neurosama

# Speech recognition and audio
SpeechRecognition
PyAudio
# For Hugging Face models (Transformers)
transformers
sentencepiece # Required by T5 tokenizers and other models
# sentencia-transformers # Not directly used yet, but good for embeddings later if needed
torch # Or tensorflow, depending on model compatibility and preference
# For IndicConformer, ensure specific dependencies are met.
# If models require specific versions, pin them e.g., transformers==4.30.0

# Indic NLP Library (potentially useful for text processing later, including T5 for translation)
# We might need this if we use specific Indic T5 models, e.g., from ai4bharat
# indic-nlp-library

# Database connectivity
cx_Oracle

# Vanna AI and dependencies
vanna
ollama # For running local LLMs that Vanna can use
chromadb # Vector database for Vanna's training data

# UI and Reporting
# Flask # For a web UI, if chosen
# Streamlit # Alternative for web UI
pandas # For data manipulation and table display
matplotlib # For generating charts
reportlab # For PDF generation
# fpdf2 # Alternative for PDF generation, often simpler for basic tables/text
openpyxl # For Excel export option, if added later (CSV is simpler)

# Note: Some models (like Whisper) might require ffmpeg to be installed on the system.
# Ensure Hugging Face CLI is configured if downloading models from the hub: `huggingface-cli login`
